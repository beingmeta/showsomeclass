<p><defn>Show Some Class</defn> (<abbrev>SSC</abbrev>) helps explore
how CSS classes and HTML elements are applied and used in a document.
It <em>highlights</em> everything which matches the <defn>current
selector</defn> by fading out everything else.</p>

  <p>The <em>current selector</em> is set by entering it in the box at
the left side of the toolbar at the top of the page.</p>
<figure></figure>
  <p>An SSC selector can be any CSS selector followed (optionally) by
a regular expression (in forward slashes) which is matched against
element content.</p>

  <p>Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or click/tap at the top of the screen to
bring up the toolbar if you can't see it.  The <kbd>Escape</kbd> key
or the <img src='{{imguri}}/redx.svgz' class='intext svg'/> <img
src='{{imguri}}/redx100x100.png' class='intext notsvg'/> icon hides
it.</p>

  <p>The <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift-Tab</kbd> keys move among
  matched elements.</p>

  <p>The <kbd>S</kbd> key or the <img
  src='{{imgroot}}/stylebraces.svgz' class='intext svg'/> <img
  src='{{imgroot}}/stylebraces100x100.png' class='intext notsvg'/>
  buttons show the rules which explicitly specify the current
  selector.</p>
<p>SSC was especially designed for working with the kind of messy HTML
and CSS generated by automatic processing, either from document
scanning or exported from WYSIWYG word processors.  (Of course,
individuals and teams have also been known to produce messy HTML and
CSS!)</p>
