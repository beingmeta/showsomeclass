<h1>Show Some Class</h1>

<p><defn>Show Some Class</defn> (<abbrev>SSC</abbrev>) is a plugin for
exploring and understanding how CSS classes are applied and used in a
document.  When SSC is active, everything matching the <defn>current
selector</defn> is normally visible and everything else is
<em>faded</em>.  This makes it easy to see where the selector applies
together with the surrounding context.</p>

<p>A companion web application (also free) adds some simple editing
tools to provide what I think is a pretty awesome copy-editor for
HTML.</p>

<p>SSC was especially designed for working with the kind of messy HTML
and CSS generated by automatic processing, either from document
scanning or exported from WYSIWYG word processors.  (Of course,
individuals and teams have also been known to produce messy HTML and
CSS!)</p>

<p>An SSC selector consists of any valid CSS selector followed by an
optional <defn>search pattern</defn> which is applied to the content
of elements.  For example, <tt>P.style1</tt> matches all paragraph
elements with the class <tt>style1</tt> and
<tt>blockquote/\bLincoln\b</tt> matches all blockquotes which contain
the (delimited) word &ldquo;Lincoln&rdquo; in the body.</p>

<p>The SSC toolbar appears at the top of the browser window.  Pressing
the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key or clicking/tapping at the top of the browser
window makes it appear.  Pressing the <kbd>Escape</kbd> key or using
the <img src='{{imguri}}/redx.svgz' class='intext svg'/> <img
src='{{imguri}}/redx100x100.png' class='intext notsvg'/> icon hides
the toolbar.  Using the <kbd>S</kbd> key or the <img
src='{{imguri}}/stylebraces.svgz' class='intext svg'/> <img
src='{{imguri}}/stylebraces100x100.png' class='intext notsvg'/> icon
toggles the style information which SSC can figure out for the current
selector.</p>
